    "1. Consider a dataset $Y=(y_1,y_2,...,y_n)$ containing $n$ realizations of $y$. Write down the likelihood of $Y$ as a function of $\\mu$ and  $\\sigma$\n",

    "2. Assume that $\\mu$ itself is Normally distributed around some mean $\\theta$ with standard deviation $\\tau$. Show that upon observing $Y$, the posterior belief about $\\mu$ remains normally distributed. Derive the posterior mean and standard deviation of $\\mu$. What do you notice about the standard deviation? Comment your finding.\n",
